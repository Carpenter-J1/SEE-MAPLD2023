### IRES 
Ionizing radiation effects spectroscopy (IRES) is a powerful technique used to characterize
the effects of ionizing radiation in devices and systems. IRES extracts stochastic features of a
waveform and uses the resulting profiles for a statistics-based assessment of transient behavior. The
presence of a transient is determined based on the likelihood that a sampled behavior is statistically
different from expected steady-state behavior.

### IRES Spectrogram Interactive Plot/Video
The link below you will see the IRES spectrogram of the SET above in (blue) with a duration of about 30us. The two vertical (green) lines represent the window size that is sailed across the SET.
